# Jola's Work in Progress

Hi All!


Yup, this is all that's here right now. I told you it wasn't very far along. I will be updating this with code stuff, and maybe a few pictures of my adventures if you call them that. But mostly code :)


Things I want to write about:
- Developing with self-published Nuget Packages
- Service Layer Patterns
- Dependency Injection and extendable interfaces
- WebApplicationFactory testing

Thanks!

/John
